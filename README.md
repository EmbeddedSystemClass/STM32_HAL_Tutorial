# STM32_HAL_Tutorial
It is a lab tutorial of CS301 Embedded System in Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). We use ALIENTEK's MiniSTM32, with the STM32F103RTC6 MCU, as the development borad. This tutorial is to help students use HAL library to build its own applications 
based on the STM32 series MCU. So, for those who do not use the same board, the pinouts and the peripherals maybe different, but the 
usage is similar and it is still helpful.
